                <h2><em>Early Life</em></h2><br>
                <p>Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore on September 28, 1929, and became, quite simply, the most popular playback singer in Bollywood's history. She sung for over 50 years for actresses from Nargis to Preity Zinta, as well as recorded albums
                    of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc). Until the 1991 edition, when her entry disappeared, the Guinness Book of World Records listed her as the most-recorded artist in the world with not less than 30,000 solo, duet,and chorus-backed songs
                    recorded in 20 Indian languages between 948 and 1987. Today that number may have reached 40,000!

                <h2><em>musical Journey</em></h2><br>
                <p>In 1942, her father's untimely death put the onus of providing for the family on her shoulders. Pandit Deenanath's friend Master Vinayak took care of the Mangeshkar family and offered her a role in the film Badi Maa. In 1949, she moved
                    to Bombay (now Mumbai), where she began learning Hindustani music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan. Lata had worked with several legendary music directors including Madan Mohan, R D Burman, the duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal and A R Rahman. She teamed
                    up with Madan Mohan for the 1960s like Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha from Anpadh, Lag Jaa Gale and Naina Barse Rim Jhim from Woh Kaun Thi?. Lata had sung over 700 songs for Laxmikant-Pyarelal, which include Mere Naseeb Mein from Naseeb and
                    Sheesha Ho Ya Dil Ho from Asha. Songs like Gata Rahe Mera Dil, and Piya Tose in Guide (1965) were recorded for S D Burman. Lata sang R D Burman’s first and last songs – in Chote Nawaab (1961) and Kuch Na Kaho in 1942: A Love Story
                    in 1994. Her collaborations with A R Rahman resulted in popular songs like Luka Chupi in Rang de Basanti (2006) and O Paalanhaare in the movie, Lagaan (2001). From Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya from Mughal-e-Azam (1960) to Ajeeb Dastaan Hai
                    Yeh, from Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai (1960) to Rangeela Re from Prem Pujari (1970) or even Jiya Jale in Dil Se, the singer had lent her voice to a number of timeless classics over the years. In 2012, Lata Mangeshkar launched her own
                    music label called LM Music. Her most recent release (March 2019) was the song Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti Ki, composed by Mayuresh Pai, which is a tribute to the Indian army and India.
